--- Backface culling enabled by default for most nodes.
---@field backface_culling boolean|nil
--- Align style determines whether the texture will be rotated with the node
--- or kept aligned with its surroundings. "user" means that client
--- setting will be used, similar to `glasslike_framed_optional`.
--- Note: supported by solid nodes and nodeboxes only.
---@field align_style "node"|"world"|"user"|nil
--- Scale is used to make texture span several (exactly `scale`) nodes,
--- instead of just one, in each direction. Works for world-aligned
--- textures only.
--- Note that as the effect is applied on per-mapblock basis, `16` should
--- be equally divisible by `scale` or you may get wrong results.
---@field scale integer|nil
--- * The texture's color will be multiplied with this color.
--- * The tile's color overrides the owning node's color in all cases.
