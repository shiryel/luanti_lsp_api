--- * Create a schematic from the volume of map specified by the box formed by
--- p1 and p2.
--- * Apply the specified probability and per-node force-place to the specified
--- nodes according to the `probability_list`.
--- * `probability_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `pos`
--- and `prob`.
--- * `pos` is the 3D vector specifying the absolute coordinates of the
--- node being modified,
--- * `prob` is an integer value from `0` to `255` that encodes
--- probability and per-node force-place. Probability has levels
--- 0-127, then 128 may be added to encode per-node force-place.
--- For probability stated as 0-255, divide by 2 and round down to
--- get values 0-127, then add 128 to apply per-node force-place.
--- * If there are two or more entries with the same pos value, the
--- last entry is used.
--- * If `pos` is not inside the box formed by `p1` and `p2`, it is
--- ignored.
--- * If `probability_list` equals `nil`, no probabilities are applied.
--- * Apply the specified probability to the specified horizontal slices
--- according to the `slice_prob_list`.
--- * `slice_prob_list` is an array of tables containing two fields, `ypos`
--- and `prob`.
--- * `ypos` indicates the y position of the slice with a probability
--- applied, the lowest slice being `ypos = 0`.
--- * If slice probability list equals `nil`, no slice probabilities
--- are applied.
--- * Saves schematic in the Luanti Schematic format to filename.

function core.create_schematic(p1, p2, probability_list, filename, slice_prob_list) end


--- * Place the schematic specified by schematic (see [Schematic specifier]) at
--- `pos`.
--- * `rotation` can equal `"0"`, `"90"`, `"180"`, `"270"`, or `"random"`.
--- * If the `rotation` parameter is omitted, the schematic is not rotated.
--- * `replacements` = `{["old_name"] = "convert_to", ...}`
--- * `force_placement` is a boolean indicating whether nodes other than `air`
--- and `ignore` are replaced by the schematic.
--- * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.
--- * **Warning**: Once you have loaded a schematic from a file, it will be
--- cached. Future calls will always use the cached version and the
--- replacement list defined for it, regardless of whether the file or the
--- replacement list parameter have changed. The only way to load the file
--- anew is to restart the server.
--- * `flags` is a flag field with the available flags:
--- * place_center_x
--- * place_center_y
--- * place_center_z

function core.place_schematic(pos, schematic, rotation, replacements, force_placement, flags) end


--- * This function is analogous to core.place_schematic, but places a
--- schematic onto the specified VoxelManip object `vmanip` instead of the
--- map.
--- * Returns false if any part of the schematic was cut-off due to the
--- VoxelManip not containing the full area required, and true if the whole
--- schematic was able to fit.
--- * Returns nil if the schematic could not be loaded.
--- * After execution, any external copies of the VoxelManip contents are
--- invalidated.
--- * `flags` is a flag field with the available flags:
--- * place_center_x
--- * place_center_y
--- * place_center_z

--- * Return the serialized schematic specified by schematic
--- (see [Schematic specifier])
--- * in the `format` of either "mts" or "lua".
--- * "mts" - a string containing the binary MTS data used in the MTS file
--- format.
--- * "lua" - a string containing Lua code representing the schematic in table
--- format.
--- * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
--- * If `lua_use_comments` is true and `format` is "lua", the Lua code
--- generated will have (X, Z) position comments for every X row
--- generated in the schematic data for easier reading.
--- * If `lua_num_indent_spaces` is a nonzero number and `format` is "lua",
--- the Lua code generated will use that number of spaces as indentation
--- instead of a tab character.

function core.serialize_schematic(schematic, format, options) end


--- * Returns a Lua table representing the schematic (see: [Schematic specifier])
--- * `schematic` is the schematic to read (see: [Schematic specifier])
--- * `options` is a table containing the following optional parameters:
--- * `write_yslice_prob`: string value:
--- * `none`: no `write_yslice_prob` table is inserted,
--- * `low`: only probabilities that are not 254 or 255 are written in
--- the `write_ylisce_prob` table,
--- * `all`: write all probabilities to the `write_yslice_prob` table.
--- * The default for this option is `all`.
--- * Any invalid value will be interpreted as `all`.
