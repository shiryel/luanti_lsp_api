---LBM (LoadingBlockModifier) definition
----------------------------------------

-- Used by `core.register_lbm`.
--
-- A loading block modifier (LBM) is used to define a function that is called for
-- specific nodes (defined by `nodenames`) when a mapblock which contains such nodes
-- gets activated (not loaded!).
-- Descriptive label for profiling purposes (optional).
-- Definitions with identical labels will be listed as one.
-- * List of node names to trigger the LBM on.
-- * Also non-registered nodes will work.
-- * Groups (as of group:groupname) will work as well.
-- Whether to run the LBM's action every time a block gets activated,
-- and not only the first time the block gets activated after the LBM
-- was introduced.
-- Function triggered for each qualifying node.
-- `dtime_s` is the in-game time (in seconds) elapsed since the block
-- was last active
