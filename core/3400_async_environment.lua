---Async environment
--------------------

--- * Queue the function `func` to be ran in an async environment.
--- Note that there are multiple persistent workers and any of them may
--- end up running a given job. The engine will scale the amount of
--- worker threads automatically.
--- * When `func` returns the callback is called (in the normal environment)
--- with all of the return values as arguments.
--- * Optional: Variable number of arguments that are passed to `func`
---@param func function
---@param callback fun(...: any): any
---@param ... unknown Variable number of arguments that are passed to `func`.
function core.handle_async(func, callback, ...) end


--- * Register a path to a Lua file to be imported when an async environment
--- is initialized. You can use this to preload code which you can then call
--- later using `core.handle_async()`.
---@param path string
function core.register_async_dofile(path) end
